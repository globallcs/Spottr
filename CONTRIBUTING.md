# Getting Started
Thank you for making the decision to contribute to Spottr, we're glad to have your help! We're going to be a bit bold and assume that you already know [how to contribute to open source projects][url-howtoopensource]. However, there are still a few prerequisites that you'll need to ensure you've taken care of before you can begin contributing to the codebase.

#### Dependencies
Currently, the only software dependency this project has is [Node JS and npm][url-nodejs]. Once you've installed `Node JS` and `npm`, you can use the terminal of your choice to run the following commands and verify the installations:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

After the software dependencies have been resolved, you can run the following command to download all of the required node modules:

```bash
npm install
```
