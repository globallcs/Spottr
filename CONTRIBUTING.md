# Getting Started
Thank you for making the decision to contribute to Spottr, we're glad to have your help! We're going to be a bit bold and assume that you already know [how to contribute to open source projects][url-howtoopensource]. However, there are still a few prerequisites that you'll need to ensure you've taken care of before you can begin contributing to the codebase.

#### Dependencies
Currently, the only dependency this project has is [Node JS and npm][url-nodejs].
